setupgrubfornfsinstall
======================

setupgrubfornfsinstall is a dialog based shell script to prepare remote network
installations. The script downloads kernel and initrd of the distribution and
either creates a boot loader entry for easy reinstallation of physical systems
or prepares a disk image for installation in qemu/kvm.

Features
--------

- install openSUSE, Fedora, Ubuntu, Slackware
- qemu/kvm support, just run setupgrubfornfsinstall with option --qemu.
- browse installation sources offered via SLP in your LAN
- browse nfs exports (special config file needed then)
- support for nfs, ftp and http
- supports grub2, grub and lilo (the latter mostly untested nowadays though)
- supports ssh/vnc installation parameters (SUSE only)

Run
---

	sudo ./setupgrubfornfsinstall

or for qemu
  
	./setupgrubfornfsinstall --qemu

Hints for headless remote installations
---------------------------------------

- add panic=10 to the boot parameters so the kernel reboots if
  something goes wrong that causes a kernel panic.
- use grubonce to tell grub to make the installation entry the
  default only once. This way the system will boot the old
  installation upon reboot if you
  donâ€™t overwrite the boot loader.
